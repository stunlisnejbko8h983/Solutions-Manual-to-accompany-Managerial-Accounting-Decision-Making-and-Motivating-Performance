  * Managerial Accounting: Making Decisions and Motivating Performance enables managers and business owners to attain the core skills they need to become integral members of their company’s decision-making teams.
 
  * This new program from established authors Srikant M. Datar and Madhav Rajan emphasizes decision-making and the effects of decisions.
